## Public Transportation App

This Public Transportation App works offline!  
Users can select a departure and arrival train station, and see a list of trains, times, and durations. A default train schedule will be provided that should be used when the application is offline. If a network connection exists, the application will query an endpoint that provides information about all arrival and departure times.  
This is my submission for project #2 in the Senior Web Development Nanodegree by Udacity. I used AngularJS as the framework and Gulp as the build process.

## Getting Started

In the root directory of the app run:

```
$ npm install
```

For developer mode:

```
$ gulp
```

For production mode:

```
$ gulp serve:dist
```

Enjoy!
